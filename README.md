Prototyping, Evaluation, and Documentation Exercise 

## Formulate a hypothesis/problem statement about the influence of location of client and server.
Our hypothesis is that depending on the geographical location of the client and server, the response time differ. The further the server is from the client, the slower the response would be, and in turn, the slower the client application will seem in terms of responsiveness.

## Plan an experiment, which will give you numbers regarding the influence of geographic location of server and client.
Our experiment included booting up 2 servers on AWS, in different locations, and pinging them to see the difference in response time.

## Execute the experiment.
Here is the result of our experiment:

## Evaluate your experiment and interpret the measurements and results.
